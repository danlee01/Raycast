# Raycast
2D Raycasting Engine

# About
During quarantine, I stumbled upon a ray-tracing demo in Minecraft. I was stunned by the how realistic the lighting was, and wanted to explore the technology behind it all.
Since I was already learning Javascript on the side, I thought it would be a great idea to create a 2D ray-tracing engine using p5.js!


# Features to be added
1. Create 3D rendering based off raycasting
2. Ability to change colors, background, number of rays
